# MinuteMaster_Automation
I have automated following cases:
- Successful Login
- Unsuccessful Login
- Creat a new Bookshelf
- Creat an already Bookshelf

As a result:
- Fields and buttons on the page are tested.
- Fields and buttons on the pop-up are tested.
- Notifications on the top right are tested.
